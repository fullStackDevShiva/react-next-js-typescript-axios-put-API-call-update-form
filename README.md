This is a simple PUT API call example with real world scenario. When we want to edit data items to the DB through web applications, we send PUT (all fields) or PATCH (partial or only a few fields) requests from the frontend that target the concerned backend APIs.

Note: Here, PUT API has been used to update the entire data object. In case of partial updates PATCH API can be used.
